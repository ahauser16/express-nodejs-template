In the context of Express.js, when you define routes in a router file that is then mounted to an app using `app.use('/items', itemRoutes);`, the path specified in `app.use` acts as a prefix to all route paths defined within `itemRoutes.js`.  Keep in mind that within `itemRoutes.js`, when you define a route as `router.get('/:name', ...)`, the full path to access that route becomes `/items/:name` because of the prefix specified in `app.use`. This is a way to organize and simplify route definitions by avoiding repetition of the base path (`/items` in this case) across all routes in the file.
